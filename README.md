# GraphImageDataExtractorWPF
Expanded functionality of the original GraphImageDataExtractor, and uses WPF instead of WinForms. 

Users are now able to zoom in using the mouse wheel, and pan my pressing the mouse wheel down, to navigate the image and ensure that the points selected are accurate down to the pixel (as much as the loaded image allows, anyway).
